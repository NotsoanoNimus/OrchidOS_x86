## Update Sept 2022

I haven't touched this project in some years now. It's a weird feeling to review it and see its README written to basically describe a [super] limited Tails Linux platform ("Ephemeral OS" as I called it). At this moment in time, I'm _finally_ working a lot more on my understanding of C programming and really grasping the best understanding I can of fundamental computing concepts. Not to mention the best practices associated with the territory.

When I originally wrote the OrchidOS bare-bones, I was not actively employed in the IT/tech sector so it was the sort of occasional therapy I needed to maintain my skills and love for programming and tinkering. I have since done a lot more and changed my career, but one day I would absolutely love to resurrect this project as something more practical on an x64 platform with UEFI in glorious C, so all hope for a rebirth is not lost.

Some of the old legacy documentation will still remain over in the `/docs/` folder for curious visitors.

Until I circle back... thanks for visiting.
